phase 1 : being able to give the circuit the inputs for the combinational circuit via the 8 inputs switches and being able to see the total number of workouts(T) on the 2 most left seven segments. what the two most right 7-segments show at this time is not important.

phase 2 : make the SKIP and FINISH push buttons work(SKIP should decrement 1 from the number of workouts and FINISH should make this number 0) (keep in mind that these push buttons are active-low)

phase 3 : make the two most right 7-segments count down from 45(for workout) and from 15(for rest). Also the number of workouts should be minus one each time the timer counts down a whole minute. and also the timer should be reset to 45 when the SKIP button is pressed. Also the counting should begin when the START button is pressed.

phase 4 : make the circuit make a beep sound each time a workout cycle is finished.

phase 5 : make the circuit make a beep sound with a different frequency when the whole workout is finished.

phase 6 : try to make the LCD work from now on

And you are done!
